                My name is Seohui Choe, a graduate from Virginia Tech with a degree in Accounting and Information Systems. 
                Although I enjoyed my time utilizing my knowledge and skills as an auditor, I always had a desire to learn technologies.
                Therefore, I used my spare time to teach myself Object Oriented Programming languages, mostly Java. 
                It sparkled my interest in technology field even though it was the first-time experiencing coding.
                Since then, I have been trying to get familiar to programming technologies such as HTML, CSS, Git and Github through working on projects and exercises daily.
                I believe that my huge interest in technology and accounting background will benefit your company.

                I would love if there were opportunity for me to be considered for Software Developer position and have the chance to discuss how my qualifications meet your company’s needs.
